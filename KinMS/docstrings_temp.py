"nSamps" cloudlets from under it. It also accounts for disk thickness if requested.

Parameters
----------
sbRad : np.ndarray or list of floats
        Radius vector (in units of pixels).

sbProf : np.ndarray or list of floats
        Surface brightness profile (arbitrarily scaled).

nSamps : int or float
        Number of samples to draw from the distribution (default is 5e5).

diskThick : float or np.ndarray/list of floats
     (Default value = 0.0)
     The disc scaleheight. If a single value then this is used at all radii.
     If a list/ndarray then it should have the same length as sbRad, and will be
     the disc thickness as a function of sbRad.

Returns
-------
inClouds : np.ndarray of floats
        Returns an ndarray of "nSamps" by 3 in size. Each row corresponds to the x, y, z position of a cloudlet.

posAng : double or np.ndarray of double
        Position angle of the disc, using the usual astronomical convention.
        Can be either a double, or an array of doubles. If single valued

        Used to create position angle warps.

gasSigma : double or np.ndarray of double
        Velocity dispersion of the gas. Units of km/s.

     (Default value = 0)
    Velocity dispersion of the gas. Units of km/s.
    Can be either a double, or an array of doubles. If single valued

    dispersion changes as a function of `velrad`.

sbprof : np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = [])
    Surface brightness profile (arbitrarily scaled) as a function of `sbrad`.

     (Default value = 0)

    the disc thickness as a function of `sbrad`.

cleanout : bool, optional
     (Default value = False)
    If set then do not convolve with the beam, and output the
    "clean components". Useful to create input for other
    simulation tools (e.g sim_observe in CASA).

nsamps : int, optional
     (Default value = 100000)
    Number of cloudlets to use to create the model. Large numbers
    will reduce numerical noise (especially in large cubes),
    at the cost of increasing runtime.

posang : double or np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = 0.0)
    Position angle of the disc, using the usual astronomical convention.
    Can be either a double, or an array of doubles. If single valued
    then the disc major axis is straight. If an array is passed then it should
    describe how the position angle changes as a function of `velrad`.
    Used to create position angle warps.

intflux : double, optional
     (Default value = 0)
    Total integrated flux you want the output gas to
    have. (In Jy/km/s).

inclouds : np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = [])

    may input vectors containing the position of the
    clouds you wish to simulate. This 3-vector should
    contain the X, Y and Z positions, in units of arcseconds
    from the phase centre. If this variable is used, then
    `diskthick`, `sbrad` and `sbprof` are ignored.

vlos_clouds : np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = [])
    This vector should contain the LOS velocity for
    each point defined in INCLOUDS, in units of km/s. If
    not supplied then INCLOUDS is assumed to be the -face
    on- distribution and that VELPROF/VELRAD should be
    used, and the distribution projected. If this
    variable is used then GASSIGMA/INC are ignored.

flux_clouds : np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = 0)
    This vector can be used to supply the flux of each
    point in INCLOUDS. If used alone then total flux in the model is equal
    to total(FLUX_INCLOUDS). If INTFLUX used then this vector denotes
    the relative brightness of the points in
    INCLOUDS.

phasecen : np.ndarray of double, optional
     (Default value = np.array([0., 0.])
    This two dimensional array specifies the morphological centre of the
